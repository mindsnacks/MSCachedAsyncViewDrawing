/**
 * @discussion this method will call `drawBlock` _on a background thread_ passing a CGRect that you can pass to a `drawRect:` method
 * of a view or a layer.
 * Once finished, it'll call the completion block on the main thread with the drawn UIImage object.
 * `MSCachedAsyncViewDrawing` objects keep an internal cache so multiple calls to this method with the same `cacheKey`
 * will result in the immediate call of `completionBlock`.
 * @param `cacheKey` make sure you create a string with the paremeters of the view. Two views configured
 * differently (say, different text or font color) should have different cache keys to avoid collisions)
 * @param backgroundColor if you want a transparent image, just pass [UIColor clearColor].
 * To generate an opaque image, pass a color with alpha = 1.
 * @param drawBlock this method is called from a background thread, so you must pay special attention to the thread safety of
 * anything you do in it. It's safe to use UIKit methods like -[UIImage drawInRect:] or -[NSString drawInRect:].
 * @return NSOperation associated with the drawing. If you're enqueuing a lot of drawing, you may want to cancel the operation
 * before it finishes if the result is not needed anymore to save resources.
